Instructions

The style is already inlined in this template for ease of use. If you'd like the version with style-in-head, shoot me a message.
If you get the style-in-head version: 

1) You must remember to send it through an in-liner (mailchimp has a good tool available) or gmail (and other) clients will strip all styling
2) If you have constituents who use Outlook - you must remember to double check your images for a "width=###" (no "px" at the end) that is not a "style". Some inliners and some wysiwyg's will strip this out, but it's a fix for outlook clients that will otherwise not respect your image sizing.
3) Double check everything else with something like litmus! I may have forgotten something.
